I have not seen my niece smile for a long time. She was a girl when they brought her father back dead, cut down by Orcs. She watched her mother succumb to grief, and she was left alone to tend her king in growing fear, doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
So it begins.
Give them a volley.
Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gates!
Hold them! Stand fast!
Aragorn, pull back to the gate!
To the gate! Draw your swords!
Hold them!
As long as you can give me!
Shore up the door!
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!
Pull everybody back. Pull them back!
They have broken through. The castle is breached! Retreat!
Gríma... Gríma... Grima...
Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?
You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
I know your face. Èowyn — Èowyn.
Gandalf?
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your leech-craft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Where is Théodred? Where is my son?
Simbelmynë. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish, and the old linger. That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.
They will be three hundred leagues from here by now! Èomer cannot help us.
I know what is that you want of me. But I would not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.
I am ready, Gamling. Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat. We will return.
We will return.
I have not seen my niece smile in a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead. Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief. And she was left alone to tend her king in growing fear. Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
What is it? What do you see?
All riders to the head of the column!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep and make haste.
No! You must do this — for me.
Follow me! Argh!
Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.
Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate, and set a watch on the surround.
Get them into the caves. Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the deeping wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep.
And who will come. Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.
Get the women and children into the caves.
There is no time. War is upon us!
No parent should have to bury their child.
A great host, you say?
How many?
Ten thousand?
...Let them come!
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn, we've seen it before. Crops can be resown. Homes rebuilt. Within these walls we will outlast them.
What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
And who will come? Elves? Dwarfs? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.
Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon-? No, my lord Aragorn. We are alone.
Who am I, Gamling?
And do you trust your king?
To whatever end.
And Rohan will answer.
Muster the Rohirrim!
Assemble the army at Dunharrow, as many men as can be found. You have two days. On the third, we ride for Gondor. And war.
Gamling…
Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.
And gladly I accept it. You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.
So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith, the doom of our time will be decided.
We shall have peace.
Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West, behind the hills, into Shadow. How did it come to this?
The fortress is taken. It is over.
When last I looked, Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
How did it come to this.
How is this possible?
So much death... what can Men do against such reckless hate?
For death and glory?
Yes...yes! The Horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep...one last time!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together!
Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath, now for ruin and a red dawn
FORTH EORLINGAS! CHARGE!
Èomer!
Reform the line. Reform the line! Sound the charge!
Rohirrim! Charge!!
Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!
Rally to me! To me!
Éowyn.
Aah!
If I go — Théoden dies.
Rohan is mine!
We shall have peace. We shall have peace, when you answer for the burning of the Westfold, and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace, when the lives of the soldiers, whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the Gates of the Hornburg, are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet, for the sport of your own crows, we shall have peace!
Gríma! You need not follow him. You were not always as you are now. You were once a Man of Rohan! Come down.
Gríma, come down. Be free of him.
Tell me, why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
What do we owe Gondor?
I take my leave.
I have left instruction. The people are to follow your rule in my stead.
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
Duty? No... I would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come.
We must ride light and swift. It's a long road ahead. The men and beast must reach the end with a strength to fight.
You shall live to see these days renewed. No more despair.
Little hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.
It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burden.
I will say no more.
Ride! Ride now for Gondor!
Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead.
I am happy for you. He is an honorable man.
It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory
And gladly, I accept it. You shall be Meriadoc, Esquire of Rohan.
Grimbold, how many?
Where are the riders of Snowbourn?
More will come.
Ah, don't listen to me. You are young and tonight is for you.
He leaves because he must.
No. We cannot.
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.
Six thousand spears. Less than half of what I'd hoped for.
Time is against us.
Make haste! We ride through the night.
Eomer. Take your Èored down the left flank.
Gamling, follow the King's banner down the center. Grimbold, take your company right, after you pass the wall. Forth, and fear no darkness!
Arise! Arise, Riders of Theoden! Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered! A sword day... a red day... ere the sun rises!
Ride now!... Ride now!... Ride! Ride to ruin and the world's ending!
Death!
Death!
Make safe this city!
Forth, Eorlingas!
I know your face. Éowyn, my eyes darken.
You already did. Éowyn, my body is broken. You have to let me go. I go to my fathers, in whose mighty company, I shall now not be ashamed. Éowyn.
